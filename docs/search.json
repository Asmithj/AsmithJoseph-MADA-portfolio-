For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Data/Github/andreashandel/online-portfolio-template\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

    "text": "The Roadmap of My Academic and Career Journey !\n\nHi there! I’m Asmith Joseph, a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics and a researcher at the Global Health Institute. Originally from sunny Tampa, Florida, my academic adventure began with a bachelor’s degree in health sciences and public health. Along the way, I explored my love for languages by earning a Master’s in French and Applied Linguistics at the University of South Florida. To top it off, I completed my Master of Public Health in Epidemiology at Florida International University.\nMy passion lies in unraveling the complexities of infectious diseases, especially HIV-tuberculosis co-infection in low- to middle-income countries. My research aims to improve tuberculosis treatments, enhance control strategies, and address the reproductive health challenges faced by those affected. I have worn many hats in the field of public health. As an ORISE Fellow at the CDC, I tackled evaluation activities that helped drive meaningful change. Before that, I served as an Epidemiologist with the Emerging Infections Program at Emory University, focusing on surveillance for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2 in Atlanta. My journey also includes time as a Clinical Research Coordinator at the University of South Florida and the University of Miami. There, I managed multiple clinical studies, including trials on HIV/AIDS, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, cognitive performance in older adults, and tobacco cessation. Through it all, my goal has been clear: to combine science, data, and human connection to make a global impact on health.\n\n\nMy Data Adventure (So Far!)\nThroughout my educational and professional journey, I’ve had the opportunity to explore various data and software tools. While I wouldn’t call myself an expert (far from it), I’ve developed a fundamental working knowledge of statistical and data analysis tools. I’ve used SAS, SPSS, EpiInfo, RedCap, Python, and R to analyze and manage datasets, and for qualitative work, I’ve worked with Dedoose and Qualtrics to navigate survey data and thematic analysis. I’m the first to admit there’s plenty of room for growth. That’s why I’m eager to dive into a Modern Applied Data Analysis course, where I aim to build more vigorous modeling, data visualization, and practical analytics skills. I desire to move beyond the basics and gain confidence in applying these techniques to solve real-world problems. For me, data analysis is a learning process—challenging but always rewarding when the results come together.\n\n\nBeyond the Books: My Passion in the Kitchen\nCooking is my happy place. I love experimenting with new recipes, blending flavors, and creating something delicious from scratch. It’s my ultimate stress reliever (and let’s be honest, much needed during this rollercoaster of a PhD journey!).\nOnce I finally wrap up this chapter of academia, I dream of taking my love for cooking to the next level by attending culinary school. And if I’m dreaming big, because why not? I’d love to study in Paris or Italy, soaking in the rich food culture and learning from the best.\nSure, it’s a far-fetched idea, but I’ve always believed in aiming high. Whether it’s unraveling the complexities of epidemiology or perfecting the art of a soufflé, I’m determined to chase the things that light me up inside.\nFor now, I’ll keep practicing in my kitchen, dreaming of the day I can create dishes worthy of a chef—or at the very least, wow my friends with a picture-perfect crème brûlée. Until then, it’s just me, my whisk, and my PhD—tackling one challenge at a time!"
